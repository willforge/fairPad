2 type of participants :
  - reviewers
  - editors


reviewers sort texts w/i a category near real-time 
editors edit own version with "winner" of same category side by side

each text has a category and a the list/number of reviewers

end of review is when a text is review by every-body

every-body is the set of registered people who show interest in the category for "general-interest"

general-interest is defined by sorting category according to fundamental needs of the members of a population (social contract).

submission of text must be linked to a "doleance" (breach of social contract) attached to category (bug/issues)


ex: no homeless -> category housing -> assertion : everyone has a decent home (according to existing decency norms)  

/!\ assertion need to be checked for coherency at submission

ambiguity : all names have their definitions
(from a global DAG dictionary)
(needs cycle detection for dictionaries)

dictionary are "immutable" for a text, and there we can only refer
to the "head" dictionary for a new text, so if definition doesn't exist
the dictionary need to be updated.

as a consequence if a new definition is produced, all texts associated with this text need to support the new definition otherwise the become obsolete/incoherent/invalid texts ("git type of conflict").

doleance -> preamble -> law -> [decret][2] ...

-> define decent
-> define home
-> define everyone

-> home -> define roof ! ...
