citizen who wants to submit a doleance need to be registered to a roud-about team
 via "/keybase/fairPad/round-about.html"

all registration get "written" in an anonymous inbox (public key) where the private key is known by EVERYONE.

- private key : [QmcgiQvkmWs3KWwVpwktu3i2zGADfvPw8P3rMHR1wAhNDg][1]
- public key: [QmQEE6A4CCxLLjMd49paDaW4W9Vv8MFRY3uDSM6XgVYCgm][2]

each member can process, verify and aggregate the registration requests.
(all private data need to be "tokenized" before publication on the network
   token=khash(salt,peerid)
   
   token=khash(DH(pubsalt),peerid) ..  (DH: Diffie–Hellman)

```
... 1) request token (required a server??)
    2) allocated slot is return (sole writer on the slot) 
    3) write in slot ...

alternative
  1) draw uniqu slot address
  2) publish address on anonymous inbox

```





1st submition of initial text need to occur on
and established tree to allow aggretion.



each node is of arity 23 (max) with tree a depth of 6 (max) 23^6 = 148M

every members are organized into groups which are included in bigger groups
such that the text aggregation is made geographically.

Ex:

1. doleance category,
2. rond-point (team),
3. district (arrondisssment),
4. city,
5. county (departement),
6. region (state),
7. country

The leaves (user nodes) are submitting texts and create a PR to their respective groups

the hashes of doleances are including in a global Merkle DAG (6 level)
by PR requests for registrating the hash at the level just above.

i.e. when a member of a group make a sync the local node is process all pending
pull request from that particular node and create a PR for wider node this member
belongs too.

### attribution of categories

each text is submitted with an initial category which is revise along the agration
by all the reviewer the category the most commonly chosen is the one asigned to
the text. every node has the option to update the metadata (like, rank, category,
defined flag, keywords, tags, label, discussion (as StackOverflow), docs,refs(?) )


2 type of participants :
  - reviewers
  - editors


reviewers sort texts w/i a category near real-time 
editors edit own version with "winner" of same category side by side

each text has a category and a the list/number of reviewers

end of review is when a text is review by every-body

every-body is the set of registered people who show interest in the category for "general-interest"

general-interest is defined by sorting category according to fundamental needs of the members of a population (social contract).

submission of text must be linked to a "doleance" (breach of social contract) attached to category (bug/issues)


ex: no homeless -> category housing -> assertion : everyone has a decent home (according to existing decency norms)  

/!\ assertion need to be checked for coherency at submission

ambiguity : all names have their definitions
(from a global DAG dictionary)
(needs cycle detection for dictionaries)

dictionary are "immutable" for a text, and there we can only refer
to the "head" dictionary for a new text, so if definition doesn't exist
the dictionary need to be updated.

as a consequence if a new definition is produced, all texts associated with this text need to support the new definition otherwise the become obsolete/incoherent/invalid texts ("git type of conflict").

doleance -> preamble -> law -> [decree][2][3] ...

-> define decent
-> define home
-> define everyone

-> home -> define roof ! ...
